# Russia banned from `2020 Tokyo Olympics`

**The World Anti-DopingAgency `executive` committee `handed down` the `mostsevere  `  punishment to date in the years-long Russian `doping saga`, issuing a four-year ban that will bar Russia from competing at the next two Olympic Games.**

Similar to the 2018 WinterOlympics in Pyeongchang, Russians who have not been `implicated` in the country's `state-sponsored` doping scheme will be allowed to compete in Tokyo as unaffiliated athletes.

**After being banned from the 2018Games, the country and its Russian Anti-Doping Agencywere `conditionally` reinstated inSeptember 2018, but Russian officials were caught earlier this year `manipulating` data from itsMoscow anti-doping laboratory and misleading WADA investigators, prompting a newchapter in a doping scheme thatcontinues to roil the international sports community.**

Furthermore, the investigators found that someone attempted to implicate whistleblower GrigoryRodchenkov, the former directorof the Moscow lab, by planting fabricated evidence in the data that he was involved in a schemeto extort money from athletes.

"Finally, fraud, lies and falsifications of unspeakable proportions have been punishedin fullswing, " Rodchenkov saidin a statement Monday. "…Russia's falsifications andcheating continued in 2019 evenwhen Russia was under scrutiny. "

In addition to the ban oninternational competition, theCompliance Review Committeealso recommended that Russianofficials be barred from sitting onboards and committees related tointernational sports governance. Russia also will not be permittedto host any major sporting eventor even apply for hosting duties.

Russia now has 21 days torespond. It can protest the matterto the Court of Arbitration forSport, which would have final say.

# 长难句解析

> The World Anti-Doping Agency executive committee handed down the most severe punishment to date in the years-long Russian doping saga, issuing a four-year ban that will bar Russia from competing at the next two Olympic Games.

> 在长达数年的俄罗斯兴奋剂风波中，世界反兴奋剂机构执行委员会宣布了迄今为止的最严处罚：俄罗斯被禁赛四年。这意味着该国将无缘接下来的两届奥林匹克运动会。

句子主干是 The World Anti-Doping Agency executive committee handed down the most severe punishment to date；in the years-long Russian doping saga 作状语；issuing a four-year ban 为现在分词短语作伴随状语；划线部分是一个由 that 引导的定语从句，对前面的 ban 进行修饰。



> After being banned from the 2018 Games, the country and its Russian Anti-Doping Agency were conditionally reinstated in September 2018, but Russian officials were caught earlier this year manipulating data from its Moscow anti-doping laboratory and misleading WADA investigators, prompting a new chapter in a doping scheme that continues to roil the international sports community.

> 2018 年，俄罗斯被禁止参加平昌冬奥会。同年 9 月，俄罗斯被恢复参赛资格，俄罗斯反兴奋剂机构也被复职，但需要满足相关条件。然而，今年早些时候，俄罗斯官员被发现篡改了莫斯科反兴奋剂实验室的数据，并误导世界反兴奋剂组织的调查员。这就将俄罗斯兴奋剂“计划”推向了一个新阶段，继续扰乱着国际体育界的秩序。

连词 but 连接了两个句子，第一个句子是 After being banned from the 2018 Games, the country and its Russian Anti-Doping Agency were conditionally reinstated in September 2018.，句子主干是逗号后面的部分，逗号前面则是一个由介词 after 引导的时间状语，它的逻辑主语就是后面主句的主语 the country and its Russian Anti-Doping Agency，“俄罗斯与俄罗斯反兴奋剂机构”。

第二个句子是 but 后面的部分，在这句话中，句子主干是 Russian officials were caught earlier this year doing sth. 后面两个现在分词短语作宾语，分别是 manipulating data from its Moscow anti-doping laboratory 及 misleading WADA investigators。划线部分为现在分词作结果状语；句子末尾是一个由 that 引导的定语从句，修饰它前面的 a doping scheme。
