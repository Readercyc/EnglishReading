# She won a `civil` case against her `alleged` `rapist`. But Japan's `rape` laws need an `overhaul`, campaigners say

伊藤诗织赢了：性侵民事诉讼案胜诉，但社会活动人士仍呼吁全面改革日本强奸法

**Shiori Ito(伊藤诗织) became a symbol of Japan's #MeToo movement after she alleged that former Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) reporter Noriyuki Yamaguchi raped her in 2015 after he invited her out for dinner.**

**On Wednesday, a Tokyo District Court judge ordered Yamaguchi , 53, to pay 3.3 million `yen` in damages to Ito, and concludedthat she had not `consented` to the act.**

"I really believe this was a `landmark` case for Japanese sex crime, " Ito said at a news conference on Thursday.

**Ito shocked Japan in 2017 by `going public` with her accusations— an unusual move in a country where it is estimated that more than 95% of sexual `assault` victims never report their rape to police,according to a 2017 survey by the `cabinet` office of Japan's central government.**

But while Shiori Ito considers Wednesday's decision a "win, " her case has also highlighted problems with how Japan's justice system deals with rape — and reignited `calls` for change.

Under Japanese law, the `prosecutor` must be able to prove that the sexual assault was a result of force or violence, and the law makes no `mention` of consent.

At Thursday's news conference,Shiori Ito `hit out` at the current laws, saying they required the survivor to prove the rape, and how much they had been threatened. "I would like to highlight this point: nonconsensual sex is rape, " she said.

Legal expert Yatagawa said she respected Shiori Ito's bravery, and thought her case would encourage other victims to `come forward`. But there were many legal changes that still needed to happen.

> Shiori Ito(伊藤诗织) became a symbol of Japan's #MeToo movement after she alleged that **former Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) reporter Noriyuki Yamaguchi(山口敬之) raped her in 2015 after he invited her out for dinner.**
>
> 在伊藤诗织断言声称2015年前任东京广播电视台的记者山口敬之在邀请她的晚宴后强奸了她后,她成为了一个日本的MeToo运动的象征

句子主干是 Shiori Ito(伊藤诗织) became a symbol of Japan's #MeToo movement；after she alleged .... 作时间状语；划线部分是一个由 that 引导的宾语从句，补充了断言的内容

> Ito shocked Japan in 2017 by `going public` with her accusations— an unusual move in a country where it is estimated that more than 95% of sexual `assault` victims never report their rape to police,according to a 2017 survey by the `cabinet` office of Japan's central government
>
> 伊藤诗织由于她公开的控诉，在2017年轰动了整个日本——这是非常不寻常的一个举动，根据2017年日本的中心政府的内阁机关的调查，这个国家估计超过95%的性侵受害者都从不会把他们被强奸的事情告诉警察

这个长句的主干为 Ito shocked Japan in 2017 by going public with her accusations，破折号后面 an unusual move 是对于 her accusations 的一个补充定义，where后面是定义从句，用于修饰country，according to 后面是状语从句用于修饰参考资料的来源

> On Wednesday, a Tokyo District Court judge ordered Yamaguchi, 53, to pay 3.3 million yen in damages to Ito, and concluded that she had not consented to the act. 
>
> 在周三，一个东京的地区法院判决了53岁的山口赔偿330万日元给伊藤诗织，并判断这并非她的自愿行为

这个长句中，开头的 On Wednesday 为时间状语，主语是 a Tokyo District Court judge，有两个并列的动词，分别是 ordered 和 concluded，由划线部分的 and 连接。长句的前半部分讲的是 a Tokyo District Court judge ordered Yamaguchi, 53, to pay 3.3 million yen in damages to Ito，两个逗号中间的数字为说明山口敬之年龄的插入语，完整的意思是“东京地方法院的法官判决 53 岁的山口敬之向伊藤支付 330 万日元的损害赔偿金”。后半句中，concluded 的前面其实省略了主语 a Tokyo District Court judge，后面的 that 引导了一个宾语从句，所以后半句讲的是“东京地方法院的法官判定，女方并非自愿发生性行为”。划线部分的 and 其实连接了东京地方法院法官判决中的两项决定。
